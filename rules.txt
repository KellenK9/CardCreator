Setting up the game:
1. Start the game with 3 distinct Champions facedown on the field and a facedown main deck of 60-100 cards.
2. Decide which player is going first then each player flips their Champions and draws 7 cards.
*If using a chess clock, it starts when player 1 draws their hand.

1. Draw a card
2. Activate a Spell card from hand.
3. Equip 1 Equipment from your hand to a Champion.
4. Activate an 'Activated Effect' of an equipped Equipment you control.
5. Activate an 'Activated Effect' of a Champion you control.

There are 3 types of cards: Champions, Equipment, and Spells.
- Champions have health, effects, and equipment slots. When all of a player's Champions are defeated: they lose the duel.
- Equipment comes in different element types and can only be equipped to a Champion's slot of the corresponding type. Only 1 Equipment can be equipped in each slot. Equipment cannot be moved from Champion to Champion.
- Spells can be activated from your hand. After a spell's effect resolves it is sent to the Grave via game rule.

Cards can have 3 types of effects: Activated, Trigger, and Passive.
- Activated Effects can be activated by the turn player and count as their turn.
- Trigger Effects can be activated by either player when a specific condition is met listed on theIR card; they don't count as a turn.
- Passive effects are not activated and are always live; they don't count as a turn.

Specific Card Rulings:

Extra Padding:
  Increases a Champion's max health by 50 and raises their current health by the same amount when equipped.
    Example: A Champion that has 60/100 health gets equipped with Extra Padding and now has 110/150 health.
  Champions may be defeated if their health drops to 0 after Extra Padding becomes unequipped.
Greedy Rage:
  Its effect does not trigger if Greedy Rage is also sent to the grave. Greddy Rage must remain on the field in order to activate.
    Example: Magma Slug has both Greedy Rage and Fire Dagger equipped and sends both to the grave to deal 40 total damage. Greedy Rage cannot activate.
    Example: Magma Slug has both Greedy Rage and Fire Dagger equipped and sends only Fire Dagger to the grave to deal 20 damage. Greedy Rage can activate to deal 20 additional damage.
