Elemental Blast:
a high-tech giant bronze cannon. The base of the cannon has four large lights that are red, blue, green, and yellow respectively. The cannon is placed in the middle of a giant cobblestone pavilion at the edge between a quaint town and lush mystical forest.

Chained Detonation:
a skinny smiling goblin standing at the entrance of a cave mine at the base of a small mountain holding the red handle of a blasting cap detonator connected by a black rope to an explosion near the top of the mountain.

Decoy:
Use Lexi and Jamie's artwork instead of AI

Pressure:
the face of a stressed goblin child sitting at a school desk. The goblin should be green but showing shades of red in the cheeks due to being flustered, with sweat rolling down his face. The goblin should be sitting at a desk holding a pencil with a sheet of paper on the desk. The background should be an immersive classroom that appears to be melting psychedelically and should feature a clock.

Sovereign of the Southern Skies:

Thunderbird:
a massive intimidating regal golden bird perched in a massive nest at the peak of a rugged mountain. The bird should have small bolts of static electricity running across and emanating from its body, and have glowing yellow eyes. The background should be a tropical fantasy archipelago with small lush islands and rocky cliff faces.

Fire Golem:

Vengeful Rage:

Tidal Wave:
a massive wave crashing down in the middle of the open ocean. It should be difficult to see under the water, but a massive Poseidon can be hazily seen under the tidal wave. There should be a thunderstorm / stormy weather.

Sacred Spring:
a bountiful spring with magical healing water sprouting out from the middle of a lush forest. The spring should be posed like a fountain but made of natural objects like mossy stone and plant life.

Rapid Winds:
a goblin dressed in farm clothes pictured horizontal above the ground holding onto a wooden post as the wind attempts to pull the goblin away. The background should feature a barn and field with winds whipping farm objects up into the air. We should see the wind throwing around multiple objects in the background including a hay bale, cow, tractor, pitchfork, and a couple goblins also dressed like western rural country folk. The sky should look ominous and be illuminated by a single massive lightning bolt.

Quarter Pillar of the Sky:
