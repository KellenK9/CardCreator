Gambit:
a gold coin flipping in the air. The coin should feature an ornately carved Zeus upon his throne. The coin should be all gold while the background features dark colors including maroon and purple.

Greedy Rage:

Memory of the Tides:
a large bright moon in the center of the image. Below the moon should be the open ocean with large waves being pulled by the moon but not yet cresting. Above the moon should be a simple night sky.

Defiance of Death:

Pressure:

Tides of Reckoning:
a quaint coastal town surrounding a tall slender mountain with a beautiful cottage sitting atop. Large waves from the nearby ocean should be crashing into the coastal town and destroying buildings, while the cottage remains safe. The sky should be cloudy and dark with sunlight shining through in a single spot illuminating the cottage.

Orpheus:
a man in ancient Greece dressed simply playing a simple lyre. The man should be sitting and illuminated by gentle firelight during dusk surrounded by a mystical forest. A golden fleece should be shown nonchalantly in the background hanging on a tree branch. The background should also picture a few small tents and shadows, but no people.
