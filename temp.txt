Chained Detonation:
a skinny smiling goblin standing at the entrance of a cave mine at the base of a small mountain holding the red handle of a blasting cap detonator connected by a black rope to an explosion near the top of the mountain.

Decoy:
Use Lexi and Jamie's artwork instead of AI

Vengeful Rage:
a gladiator ring or colosseum with one angry passionate gladiatorraising his sword in the center of the arena facing a snarling armored lion, with a gladiator laying face down on both sides of the arena.

Rapid Winds:
a goblin dressed in farm clothes pictured horizontal above the ground holding onto a wooden post as the wind attempts to pull the goblin away. The background should feature a barn and field with winds whipping farm objects up into the air. We should see the wind throwing around multiple objects in the background including a hay bale, cow, tractor, pitchfork, and a couple goblins also dressed like western rural country folk. The sky should look ominous and be illuminated by a single massive lightning bolt.

Quarter Pillar of the Sky:
a massive marble greek pillar extending from buried beneath the ground into the clouds above and seemingly never ending. The pillar should appear to sprout from the ground upheaving the surrounding dirt and trees and should be surrounded by a vast immersive valley filled with lush forest, rolling hills, and serene waterfalls.
