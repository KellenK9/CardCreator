Prompts for new card artwork

Generic wording:
The next image I would like you to generate for my fantasy card game is 
The focus of the image should be 
The style of the image should be colorful, detailed, intricate, mystical, epic, realistic, gritty, immersive, psychedelic, and cartoon inspired with nice line work.


Replacement Order:

Ocean's Vengence:

Shoddy Craftsmanship:

Bloodrite:

The Missing Ingredient:

One in the Chamber:
Revolver with an open chamber showing a single bullet left. First person view looking at empty black slots in the back of the chamber with the gun pointed forward. One of the empty slots has the back of a metal bullet loaded inside. Background includes a lush forest.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Initial product line could include 4 starter decks and a set of booster packs.
Starter decks should each be themed around an element and include a God and a Golem.
Starter decks should generally include 1 of each spell and 2 of each equipment.
Booster packs should include both normal and holo cards where every holo card is also available as a non-holo in the box or starter decks.
The air starter deck will include 4 Champions, other decks could also do the same

Rulebook should be included in starter decks and there's 2 paper options.
Each starter deck should have a card with a quick 'what can you do on your turn' guide on one side and a description of how the deck works on the other.

Currently, all text comfortably fits into either: 1 effect on 3 or less lines or 2 effects on a total of 4 or less lines.
The sole exception is Bloodrite being 2 effects on 5 total lines. It doesn't seem like that long of an effect.
Other future cards were just as wordy and archetypal cards may struggle to remain super short.
Removing/Reworking Bloodrite would allow me to increase text size across this set of cards. It would require future cards to have shorter text or reduce font size if the text is longer.
