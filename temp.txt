a shiny reflective shield etched with a detailed head of medusa and wielded by the mighty goddess Athena, surrounded by a raging battlefield. The shield should be in the center of the image and strapped to the forearm of Athena. Athena should have a fierce look, shouting, and raising her spear. The background should be a crowded battlefield where greek and trojan warriors clash with swords, shields, chariots, spears, and archers.
